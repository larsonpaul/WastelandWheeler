To use the player cam: attach to main camera, select proper object in the drop down in the inspector to attach. MAKE SURE OFFSET Z IS -1 OF THE REST OF THE SCREEN. In the CameraMove Component, choose player.

To use player movement, create a custom layer called ground and apply it to all your platforms, then attach script to the player and select ground tag in the drop down as "Ground". Use left/right to move and space to jump.

Hope this helps,
