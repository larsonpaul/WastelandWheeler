# Wasteland Wheeler

This was a group project for CMPT 306: Game Mechanics.

Wasteland Wheeler is an endless top-down shooter with linear progression, dynamic difficulty, and various level types. 

During development, our group of 6 met every week to discuss what each of us had accomplished in the past week and what we would aim to accomplish in the following week. We effectively communicated any problems we were having, what we envisioned for the game, and what needed polishing. It was a great experience, and one that I believe will aid me in all of my future group projects. 

My primary contributions to the project were player controls, camera control, powerups, and the Arena level.
